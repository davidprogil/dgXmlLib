# Light Weight XML library for c++

# Getting Started
## How-to integrate
### Code
./src/dgXmlLib.cpp has an example of the code that can be used to read XML files. This file is not part of the library, it is just an example
### Library
The library is composed of the files inside ./src/dgXmlLib, depending on your compilation mechanism, include the headers in your project (see the example) and find a way to include the library source code into your compilation framework e.g. makefiles, cmake, etc.
## How-to compile and run the example
